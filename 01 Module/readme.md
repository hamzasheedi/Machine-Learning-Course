**Modules – Your Structured AI & Machine Learning Journey**
===========================================================

Welcome to the **Modules** section of the AI & Machine Learning Roadmap.This is your **step-by-step learning pathway**, carefully structured to take you from **absolute beginner** to **advanced AI practitioner**.

Each module is designed with:

*   ✅ Clear learning objectives
    
*   📚 Curated free resources
    
*   🛠️ Hands-on projects
    
*   📈 Gradual increase in difficulty
    

You can follow the modules **sequentially** for the best results, or **mix and match** based on your prior experience.

**How to Use These Modules**
----------------------------

*   **Beginners:** Start from Module 0 and move forward step by step.
    
*   **Intermediate Learners:** Jump directly to Machine Learning or Deep Learning modules.
    
*   **Advanced Learners:** Focus on Generative AI, NLP, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning modules.
    

Each module builds on the previous one, ensuring you gain both **theoretical understanding** and **practical skills**.
